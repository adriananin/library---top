# Library Project

This is a simple library project built with HTML,CSS and JS that allows you to keep track of the books you've read or want to read. You can add new books, mark them as read or unread, and remove books from your library.

# Usage

To mark a book as read or unread, click on the "Mark as Read" or "Mark as Unread" button next to the book's information. This will toggle the book's read status.

To remove a book from your library, click on the "Remove" button next to the book's information. This will remove the book from your library and update the display.
